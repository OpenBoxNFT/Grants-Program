## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Web 3.0 & A decentralized multi-chain NFT MarketPlace
- OpenBox  is a multi-chain aggregated decentralized NFT trading market, supporting ETH, BSC, Polygon,and supporting more chains shortly: Polkadot（Wasm,RMRK）, Avalanche, Solana, Flow...Utilize blockchain technology to create immutable digital resources and ownership transfer channels for physical NFT works, game equipment, art, music, books... and establish limited digital resources.

Users can mint, share, collect, auction, and trade in the marketplace, which is realized through blockchain intelligent contracts without central control and secure copyright ownership. Protected ownership will be established and guaranteed using NFTs, where each NFT item has a unique and immutable blockchain identifier. At the same time, the corresponding metadata will be permanently stored in decentralized storage platforms such as IPFS and Arweave.
In the early stage, Box will mainly support popular  ecological chains that adopt EVM-based casting standards of 721 and 1155. Creators can complete the creation, casting, and storage of NFTs in a few minutes. Users can buy, sell, and auction their NFTs on the platform.

At the same time, Box will also build a Mystery Box system so that users can enjoy more collection fun.
OpenBox is committed to serving creators around the world and inspiring creativity. At the same time, more high-quality works will be oriented to users...

- We will  Building Multichain NFT MarketPlace on Substrate Blockchain.We will support NFT minting and transaction circulation based on Wasm, RMRK... based on the Polkadot ecosystem.Finally, with the help of Polkadot's across-chain technology, to achieve NFT's across-chain circulation transactions. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
