## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Web 3.0 & A decentralized multi-chain NFT MarketPlace
- OpenBox  is a multi-chain aggregated decentralized NFT trading market, supporting ETH, BSC, Polygon,and supporting more chains shortly: Polkadot（Wasm,RMRK）, Avalanche, Solana, Flow...Utilize blockchain technology to create immutable digital resources and ownership transfer channels for physical NFT works, game equipment, art, music, books... and establish limited digital resources.

Users can mint, share, collect, auction, and trade in the marketplace, which is realized through blockchain intelligent contracts without central control and secure copyright ownership. Protected ownership will be established and guaranteed using NFTs, where each NFT item has a unique and immutable blockchain identifier. At the same time, the corresponding metadata will be permanently stored in decentralized storage platforms such as IPFS and Arweave.
In the early stage, Box will mainly support popular  ecological chains that adopt EVM-based casting standards of 721 and 1155. Creators can complete the creation, casting, and storage of NFTs in a few minutes. Users can buy, sell, and auction their NFTs on the platform.

At the same time, Box will also build a Mystery Box system so that users can enjoy more collection fun.
OpenBox is committed to serving creators around the world and inspiring creativity. At the same time, more high-quality works will be oriented to users...

- We will  Building Multichain NFT MarketPlace on Substrate Blockchain.We will support NFT minting and transaction circulation based on Wasm, RMRK... based on the Polkadot ecosystem.Finally, with the help of Polkadot's across-chain technology, to achieve NFT's across-chain circulation transactions. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- OpenBox uses the Substrate architecture for development because Substrate not only supports WebAssembly (Wasm) and is perfectly compatible with EVM. OpenBox can support the casting and trading of NFTs based on EVM, RMRK, and Wasm. The substrate is also a necessary condition for OpenBox to support NFT cross-chain transactions in the later stage.
- Target audience： own user base,NFT collectors，collaborative Investment Community,The former partner's cryptocurrency website has more than 700,000 DAU and can cooperate to convert users. He will also give guidance on traffic acquisition and user conversion.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Multi-chain NFT collection and transaction, High gas solution： NFT cross-chain trade , collection fun, and social sharing
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - There are some products with similar functions, but no platform supports multi-chain, cross-chain, and the logic of the mysterious box on the chain designed by itself like OpenBox. Moreover, OpenBox has advantages in brand promotion, operation, marketing, and creator resources.

## Development Status :open_book:
The team has completed the construction of the overall logical framework and the erection of the front-end page, which can demonstrate essential functional interaction：https://openbox.io/ . The development of NFT minting, trading, auction contracts, and back-end is in progress to improve the debugging of API functions displayed on the front-end. Currently, a Pre-Seed round of financing is also underway to address development and operating funding issues.
